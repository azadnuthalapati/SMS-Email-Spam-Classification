# SMS-Email-Spam-Classification
In this project, I explored various machine learning algorithms to tackle the problem of spam detection in SMS and emails. The task was to build a robust classifier that can accurately distinguish between spam and legitimate messages. I experimented with a wide array of classifiers, including:

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KN)
Multinomial Naive Bayes (NB)
Decision Trees (DT)
Logistic Regression (LR)
Random Forest (RF)
AdaBoost (ABC)
Bagging Classifier (BgC)
Extra Trees Classifier (ETC)
Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT)
XGBoost (XGB)
Each model was evaluated based on its accuracy and precision. Among the top-performing models were:

KNeighbors: Accuracy 90.5%, Precision 100%
Multinomial Naive Bayes: Accuracy 97.1%, Precision 100%
Random Forest: Accuracy 97.5%, Precision 98.3%
Support Vector Classifier: Accuracy 97.6%, Precision 97.5%
Ultimately, the Multinomial Naive Bayes (NB) model stood out as the best choice, delivering an impressive balance of accuracy and precision, making it ideal for handling the nuances of spam detection.
